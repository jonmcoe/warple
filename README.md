# Warple

Deployed at https://timewarple.com

Warple allows Wordle enthusiasts, who typically can play only one specified puzzle per day, the opportunity to play all puzzles since the start. While the daily/communal nature of Wordle is a lot of its appeal, some may additionally be interested in enjoying those puzzles they've missed. Original at https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/ . Many thanks to Wordle's creator https://github.com/powerlanguage , I've had a lot of fun with it and made this project bc I wanted to enjoy the ~200 puzzles from before I began daily playing.

Most functional changes performed by monkeypatching the JS date object in index.html . Some minor text / display changes and the addition of the History modal (accessed via the clock icon at the top left) were performed by modifying the JS bundle.
